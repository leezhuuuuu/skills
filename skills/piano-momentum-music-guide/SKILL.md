> **Source**: This skill is derived from [anthropics/skills PR #178](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/pull/178) by @cherishwins.

A comprehensive guide for piano learning and music theory education. This skill helps Claude assist users in learning piano at any level, from absolute beginners to advanced players.

## Piano Fundamentals

### Getting Started

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Keyboard Layout** | 88 keys, 7 octaves, white and black keys pattern |
| **Hand Position** | Relaxed curved fingers, wrist level, thumb on middle C |
| **Posture** | Straight back, feet flat, proper distance from keyboard |
| **Basic Posture** | Sit at middle C position, arms relaxed, shoulders down |

### Key Concepts

```markdown
## Notes and Keys
- White keys: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (natural notes)
- Black keys: Sharp (#) and flat (b) notes
- Octaves: 8-note cycles, middle C is reference point

## Scales
- Major scale: Whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half
- Minor scale: Whole-half-whole-whole-half-whole-whole
- C Major: No sharps or flats, good starting point

## Chords
- Triad: Three notes played together (root, third, fifth)
- Major chord: Root + 4 semitones + 3 semitones
- Minor chord: Root + 3 semitones + 4 semitones
```

## Practice Techniques

### Effective Practice Methods

| Technique | Description | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Slow Practice** | Start at 50% speed, focus on accuracy | 10-15 min |
| **Chunking** | Learn in small sections (2-4 measures) | Per section |
| **Repetition** | Repeat problematic sections 3-5 times | As needed |
| **Sight Reading** | Read and play new music at first sight | 5-10 min |
| **Ear Training** | Develop pitch recognition and dictation | 5 min daily |

### Practice Schedule

```python
# Example daily practice structure (60 minutes)
practice_plan = {
    "warm_up": {
        "duration": 5,
        "activities": ["scales", "arpeggios", "finger exercises"]
    },
    "technique": {
        "duration": 10,
        "activities": ["scales (2 octaves)", "chord progressions", "hanon exercises"]
    },
    "repertoire": {
        "duration": 25,
        "activities": ["new piece (15 min)", "review piece (10 min)"]
    },
    "sight_reading": {
        "duration": 10,
        "activities": ["new music", "rhythm exercises"]
    },
    "ear_training": {
        "duration": 5,
        "activities": ["interval recognition", "chord identification"]
    },
    "cool_down": {
        "duration": 5,
        "activities": ["relaxed playing", "review progress"]
    }
}
```

## Music Theory

### Essential Theory Concepts

```markdown
## Rhythm
- Beat: Regular pulse in music
- Tempo: Speed of the beat (BPM)
- Time Signature: 4/4 (most common), 3/4 (waltz), 6/8 (compound)

## Harmony
- Tonic: Home chord, provides resolution
- Dominant: Fifth chord, creates tension
- Subdominant: Fourth chord, transitional

## Form
- Binary: Two contrasting sections (A-B)
- Ternary: Three sections (A-B-A)
- Sonata: Exposition, Development, Recapitulation
```

### Intervals

| Interval | Semitones | Sound Quality |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Minor 2nd | 1 | Very tense |
| Major 2nd | 2 | Neutral |
| Minor 3rd | 3 | Sad |
| Major 3rd | 4 | Happy |
| Perfect 4th | 5 | Stable |
| Perfect 5th | 6 | Strong |
| Major 6th | 9 | Bright |
| Octave | 12 | Complete |
